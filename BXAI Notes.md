# Public Speaking
- _Intentional_ first impression
- I **help** (people) (do something) **so they can** (achieve something)
- Talk about your value, not your job title
- It's a _learnable_ skill, practice a lot
- Be yourself... **the best version** of yourself
	- _Your own unique & best way_ of speaking style
- Don't aim to be a perfect speaker
- Body language
	- Vary your gestures
	- Use positive gestures: nodding/mirroring
	- Effectiveness of your presentation is judged on Body Language (55%), Voice (38%), Message (7%)
- P.R.E.P: Point - Reason (because...) - Example - Point
	- Get across your point quickly & concisely

I am an AI speech researcher. I help speakers of underrepresented languages have better access to technology, so they

**AI can make people more unique** by automating tasks that anyone can do

# Lecture by Chiharu Tokoro (Waseda)
- **Goal**: Resource decoupling & impact decoupling both at the same time
	- GDP ⬆️, less resource consumption ⬆️, less impact to environment ⬇️
- Carbon neutrality tends to require more resource consumption 
- **Solution**: Circular economy - new _economic model_
- We need more _inner loops_ (kinda like skip-connections)
	- Effective for both carbon neutrality & resource recycling
	- Need to change business forms & consumer behaviors (promoting recycling)
- Technological issues for resources circulation
	- Shredding: Efficiency ⬆️, Selectivity ⬇️
	- Hand dismantling: Efficiency ⬇️, Selectivity ⬆️
	- Most existing technologies are a trade-off between the two
- Smart grinding for recycling: washing-machine-like machine
- Other external forces for separation: electrical, optical, etc
- _Manufacturers_ need to work on making the products _easy to dismantle_
	- There are movements in legislation (EU)
- Common materials (e.g. carbon) should be circulated _locally_, and rarer materials (e.g. gold) should _globally_
- New major innovations would come from interface separation technologies

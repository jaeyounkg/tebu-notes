The Cambridge Handbook of Learning Sciences (R. K. Sawyer, 2005)

# Important points about (deep) learning
- Deeper conceptual understanding (as opposed to knowing facts and procedures)
- Focusing on (actively participating in) learning, in addition to teaching
- Creating learning environments
- Building on a learner’s prior knowledge
- Reflection
- Authentic practices
	- Engaging in activities that are similar to the everyday activities of professionals who work in a discipline
- Situativity view of knowledge
	- Knowledge workers almost always apply their expertise in complex social settings, with a wide array of technologically advanced tools & old-fashioned tools.
	- Knowledge is not just a static mental structure inside the learner’s head (transmission and acquisition conception of learning)
	- Knowing is a process that involves the person, the tools and other people in the environment, and the activities in which that knowledge is being applied.

# Important goals of learning sciences
- To identify exactly what practices are appropriate for students to engage in and learn
- How learning environments can be designed that are age-appropriate, without losing the authenticity of professional pactice

# Foundations of learning sciences

## Constuctivism
-   Children’s knowledge and how their minds work is qualitatively different than that of adults (Piaget).
-   We need a very good understanding of what children know when they come to the classroom.
	-   Requires sophisticated research into children’s cognitive development

## Cognitive Science

### Representation
Intelligent behavior is based on representations in the mind, referring to “knowledge structures”: beliefs, facts, procedures, models.
-   Representations are thought of analogous to pointers in programming languages: the way knowledge is structured in the brain may be similar to how bigger data structures are formed by pointing to smaller data structures with pointers.

### The cognitive bases of expertise
-   Large and complex set of representational structures
-   Large set of procedures and plans
-   Ability to apply and adapt those plans to each situation’s unique demands
-   Ability to reflect on one’s own cognitive processes while they are occuring

### Reflection
-   Experts are better than novices at reflective activities, like planning and criticizing their work.
-   Computer support for developing learners’ ability to reflect on their own thinking

### Problem solving
Problem solving is concieved of as searching through a problem space that contains beliefs and mental representations until a goal state is reached.
-   Important because knowledge work typically requires problem solving

### Thinking
-   Informal (good and bad) reasoning people engage in when they’re faced with real-life problems with no simple answers & everyday decision making
-   (Good and bad) thinking strategies and how they develop over the lifespan

## Educational Technology
So far, educational software has been based on instructionist theories, acting as an expert authority. Computers should take on a more facilitating role, helping learners to collaborate / reflect on their developing knowledge / etc.

## Sociocultural Studies
Almost all learning occurs in a complex social environment outside of formal schooling. Thus learning should not be thought of as a mental process occurring within the head of an isolated learner.
-   Teamwork, collaboration, group dynamics, and the role of social context

## The nature of knowledge work
Scientific knowledge (for example) is not simply a body of statements and logical operations, but an understanding of how to go about doing science & deep knowledge of models and explanatory principles connected into an integrated conceptual framework.
-   Scientific knowledge is situated, practiced, and collaboratively generated.

# Processes Involved in Learning

## Learning Environment

### Elements
-   People (teachers, learners, etc) and computers, and the roles they play
-   Architecture and layout of the room, and physical objects in it
-   Social and cultural context

### Questions
-   **How** much support for the student should come from the teacher, etc?
-   **How** can we create a culture where learners feel like a “learning community”?
-   **How** can we design materials and activities that keep students motivated?

## The transition from Novice to Expert Performance
How do experts acquire their expertise?
-   **Study** how novices think and what misconceptions they have

## Using Prior Knowledge
Learning always takes place against a backdrop of existing knowledge. **How**

## Scaffolding
The support that promotes deep learning - actively participating in constructing one’s knowledge
-   Like providing prompts and hints

## Externalization and Articulation
The best learning happens when learners articulate their unformed and still developing understanding throughout the process of learning. This is important because it makes reflection possible.
-   Articulating <-> Learning. A mutually reinforcing feedback loop.
-   Articulation is more effective if it is scaffolded. Students need help in articulating their developing understandings - in a certain form that is most likely to result in useful reflection. **How**

## Reflection
-   When learners articulate their developing understandings, learning environments should support them in reflecting on what they have articulated. **How**

## Building from Concrete to Abstract Knowledge
Natural progression of learning starts with more concrete information and gradually becomes more abstract.
-   Visual representations of knowledge: abstract concepts, step-by-step processes of scientific inquiry, etc
-   Scaffolding is used in the process of making the abstract concrete.
-   Visual and spatial understandings precede verbal understandings in many cases.

# Notes

## Schema
A schema is mental and physical behaviour which operates in a unitary nature and unifies past adaptations to the environment into complex and virtually automatic systems of responses. 
-  Whenever there is any order or regularity of behaviour, a particular response is possible only because it is related to other similar responses which have been serially organized.
-  A system of responses will follow whenever we encounter a given stimulus situation which is relevant to one aspect of the schema.
-  From a neurological perspective, a schema is an integrated pattern of cellular activity built up in the course of repeated experience in similar situations.
-  Has both “stereotyped” aspects and “dynamic” aspects to it
-  This complex activity is applicable to a greater variety of situations than single responses.
-  The extent of the versatility depends on the variety of experience where it is built.
- **Learning advances by a series of schemas** which increase in complexity as they assimilate new elements (reconstructing).
-  Is a habitual skill, applied to motor activity
- Is a concept, applied to cognitive processes. (A category of knowledge that helps us to interpret and understand the world?)**

### Examples of schemas
-   Object schemas
-   Person schemas
-   Social schemas
-   Self-schemas
-   Event schemas
-   Prejudice


### How schemas affect learning
[source](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-schema-2795873)
-   They influence what we pay attention to.
-   They impact how quickly people learn.
-   They help simplify the world.
-   They allow us to think quickly.
-   They can change how we interpret incoming information.
-   They can be remarkably difficult to change.

### What does schema even mean, anyway??!
Schemata are frequently defined as the form of mental representation for generic knowledge, but are then used as the term for the representation of all knowledge.

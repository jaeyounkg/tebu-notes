# Cairo

Seems like the biggest visualization library in DataHaskell, however it doesn't even work out-of-the-box because of some version confict issues???

- `Chart-diagarms` is available in `lts-16.31` but not in `lts-11.22`
- `Chart-cairo` is available in `lts-11.22` but not in `lts-16.31`
- Every example code in the [official wiki](https://github.com/timbod7/haskell-chart/wiki) requires both to be installed
- [ref1, reddit question](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/pyqcbo/how_do_i_add_charts_to_my_stack_project/)

Wtf is this shit???

The repository is not really actively maintained since 2016-2017...

# Part 1: Opportunity

## The Matthew Effect
_"무릇 있는 자는 받아 풍족하게 되고 없는 자는 그 있는 것까지 빼앗기리라"_ - 마태복음 25:29
- Most hockey players in Major Junior A are born in Jan/Feb/Mar; this is not coincidence
- Small incentives (caused by arbitrary circumstances such as the month you're born in) accumulate throughout your life and make big differences

## The 10,000-Hour Rule
_"In Hamburg, we had to play for eight hours."_
- People who practiced 10,000 hours were in the right circumstances (by chance) to begin with, that supported them to be able to practice all those hours

## The Trouble with Geniuses
- Intelligence tests only test one type (_convergence_) of intelligence; other types (_divergence_) of intelligence are also important for success
- Beyond a certain threshold (around 120 I.Q.), it _does not matter_ how smarter you are
- (The Termites) In the end, _family background_ was the most important indicator of success; intelligence _did not matter at all_

## The Three Lessons of Joe Flom
- Joe Flom couldn't get into the shiny top firms; instead, he had to set up one of his own, specializing in company lawsuits, which wasn't popular at that time
- Later, lawsuits between companies started becoming more popular, and Joe Flom ran the only firm that specialized in it; he then became _so damn successful_

# Part 2: Legacy

## Harlan, Kentucky
_"Die like a man, like your brother did!"_
- People in Harlan killed each other more because of "culture of honor" because they're from Scotland, Northern Ireland etc., where they have an economy based on livestock like sheep
- This effect persists well into modern America, demonstrated in a university experiment where they insulted people (_"asshole"_) and southerners consistently got more angry, despite their middle/upper class family backgrounds

## The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes
_"Captain, the weather radar has helped us a lot"_
- Distance-Superiority index (or something)
- Explains the Korean Air crash at Guam, where the First Officer and the Flight Engineer knew something was wrong but couldn't communicate it directly (they just hinted, once each) to the Captain

## Rice Paddies and Math Tests
_"No one who can rise before dawn 360 days a year fails to make his family rich"_
- Growing rice paddies is a bit like the garment work done by the Jewish immigrants to New work; it's _meaningful_, _complex_ and _autonomous_
- Chinese farmers worked hard like shit: _around 3,000 hours per year_, in contrast to 1,200 hours for medieval European farmers (they literally hibernated during the winter) or <1,000 hours for the hunter gatherer !Kung people
- Maths is not so much about innate ability (of ethnic groups) but about diligence: the rankings of the TIMSS math test were _the same_ as the rankings of the number of questionnaire items answered by the same students [^1]
- Asians are better at maths _because they're harder workers_

# Definition & Intuitions
- A topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point
- The dimension of a manifold is the number of parameters (variables) needed to describe every point on the manifold
  - Ex) a unit circle can be described entirely as $(\sin\theta,\cos\theta)$

# Examples
**Things that are manifolds...**
- Lines (1d)
- Circles (1d)
- Planes (2d)
- Spheres (2d)
- Toruses (2d)
- The Klein bottle (2d)
- Balls (3d)

**Things that are not manifolds...**
- Figure eights

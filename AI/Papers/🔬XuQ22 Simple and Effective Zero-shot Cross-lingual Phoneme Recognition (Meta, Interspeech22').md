# Methodology
- Compute distance between phonemes by the Hamming edit distance between the [[Articulatory Features|articulatory feature]] vectors
- Map each phoneme in the training set to its closest one in the target vocabulary
- For remaining uncovered target phonemes, map to the closest ones in the training set

## Evaluation
Phonetic Token Error Rate (PTER)

# Experiments

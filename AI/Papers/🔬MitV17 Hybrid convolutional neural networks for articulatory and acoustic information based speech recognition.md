[[MitraV_2017_Hybrid convolutional neural networks for articulatory and acoustic information.pdf]]

- Speech-to-articulatory inversion: estimate _continuous_ articulatory variables from acoustic features
- Proposes Hybrid CNN (HCNN) network where two parallel layers jointly model the acoustic and articulatory spaces
	- The decisions are fused at the output context-dependant (CD) state level
